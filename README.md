# NBAll'd - NBA All Data Navigator

Browse historical data and visualize statistics and analytics over the years in one single app. For teams and fans.

## Introduction

This project was developed as an assignment in an advanced visualization course, included in my masters degree. The final goal was to present an application done in Python, mainly with recourse of Plotly library.

The starting point was the [NBA Database](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/wyattowalsh/basketball) downloaded through the Kaggle platform. This is a robust and complete dataset on many NBA information in all the fixtures played over the years. This repository contains all the data needed for the visualization so no data treatment is necessary. Complementary files were added to show the early stages of the project.

:warning: **Disclaimer**: This dataset is updated daily but since the application would be static, the last season accounted was the previous one at the time of development (22/23 season).
